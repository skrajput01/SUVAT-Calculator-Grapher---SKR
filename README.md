# Ultimate-SUVAT-Calculator-Grapher---SKR
Forgive me for the boastful title - I haven't found any SUVAT calculator as in-depth as this. This code takes user inputs and calculates missing values and graphs them.  S = Displacement, U = Initial Velocity, V = Final Velocity, A = Acceleration, T = Time Enter 3 known SUVAT variables and the calculator will find the remaining two as well as the maximum displacement and projected trajectory. Displacement, Velocity &amp; Acceleration-Time graphs will also be plotted as well as points of interest on each graph. a projection of the projectile's path will also be plotted as a dashed line on the same graph. Primarily uses SUVAT rearrangements over iterative processes as I am a Physicist first, and Programmer by hobby. Accounts for errors that can occur with certain SUVAT inputs.
The code's extensive length also accounts for errors that may occur, showing clear error messages in all possible cases of error which occur in SUVAT calculations
