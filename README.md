Takes user inputs and calculates missing values and graphs them.  S = Displacement, U = Initial Velocity, V = Final Velocity, A = Acceleration, T = Time Enter 3 known SUVAT variables and the calculator will find the remaining two as well as the maximum displacement and projected trajectory. Displacement, Velocity & Acceleration-Time graphs will also be plotted as well as points of interest on each graph. a projection of the projectile's path will also be plotted as a dashed line on the same graph. Primarily uses SUVAT rearrangements over iterative processes as I am a Physicist first, and Programmer by hobby. Accounts for errors that can occur with certain SUVAT inputs.
